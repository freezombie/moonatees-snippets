# moonatees-snippets

Snippets from our gamelab project. I was the game designer, second programmer, did some audio, presented the game along with our producer, kept up project timetables and asset lists etc. Project organization stuff is not here, but it was basically done using 1 page design documents, excel and trello.

Code from 2016-17.
